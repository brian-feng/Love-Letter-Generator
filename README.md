Love Letter Generator
----------------------

by Brian Feng, for CMPM 169 taught by Tyler Coleman

This program will generate a love letter when given an adjective. You can save the results by right clicking the image and then pressing "save image as...". This program is made using p5js.

Postmortem:

I sure do have a lot of regrest after making this project. I started this out in Python, thinking that I could make the python processing work with my natural language processing code. It didn't. I ended up using Turtle to make the graphics instead, but Turtle is super slow and horrible. I ended up submitting the Python version for my video, but it felt so bad because it ran slow and didn't make pretty results. The p5js version was in the making at the time. If I were given the chance to remake this project, I would never start with Python again. Even though making the language processing in Javascript was marginally harder, the visuals are so much better and faster. It's also hostable on websites which is a big plus. Furthermore, I would like to have added a bit more to the range of cute add-ons. As of submission, the program randomly generates hearts and flowers, but maybe I could've added some more themes like stars. Ultimately, I'm pretty happy with how these turn out, even if some of the poems don't make sense. I even added a few easter eggs. Hint: use the word "blue".

Artistic Statement:

This is a program that randomly generates "Roses are red" poems on a randomly generated love letter. You are allowed a single word of input. This program was made in Javascript with the help of p5js for the visuals. I made these because Roses are red poems are a slowly dying artform. The limitation of the format is what gives it life, I think. With only four lines and an uncertain yet finite number of words, the writer must express whatever they wish to express. I think it takes a level of cleverness and wit to be able to come up with Roses are red poems on the spot. I, however, don't have that wit. You, perhaps, might not either. Feel free to use this program for whatever you need. It is a very cute joke-ish card to send to friends (hopefully not actual love interests) and an easy way to use all four possible messages in hit game Monsters Seeking Monsters.
